# Systems-Analysis-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project was the owner of a company called DriverPass. He wanted to make a system that would allow students to study and train for the driving test.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I did a good job understanding the overall business needs of the client and making sure they were noted in my business requirements document.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my UML diagrams. I was using LucidChart to create them and didn't have many shapes to use since I was on a free account. They capture the overall functionality of the system but I would add more detail to make my design easier to follow.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I looked at what the overall goal of the system was and what features the owner desired for the system. It is important to consider the user's needs because ultimately they are the ones that will be using the system. If it doesn't satisfy their needs then the project is a failure.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
For this project I had to create a business requirements document to identify all the initial requirements of the program. I believe this is a great approach because it forces you to think aboout what the client wants and allows you to write it down and get feedback before you start coding anything. We then made a software design document to show our proposed design for the system. This also allows you to get feedback on the system and make sure that you incorporated all of the users needs in your system. Both of these are excellent tools that I will be using in the future.
